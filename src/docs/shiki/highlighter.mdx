## Installation

1. Install the following dependencies:

```bash title="Shiki Dependencies"
npm install @shikijs/themes @shikijs/langs -D
```

2. Create a `src/utils/shiki-highlighter.ts` file and add the following code:

For better performance, this utility only imports the languages and themes that you will use in the application.

<ShowSource component="shiki-highlighter" />

This utility exports:

- `highlight()`: A function that initializes and returns a Shiki highlighter instance with the specified theme and languages.
- `Themes`: A type with the available themes. You can use it in your UI components to type the `theme` prop.
- `Languages`: A type with the available languages. You can use it in your UI components to type the `language` prop.

## Usage

You can use the `highlight` function to get syntax highlighted code. For example:

```ts title="Shiki Highlighter Usage"
import { highlight } from "@/utils/shiki-highlighter";

const code = `console.log('hello')`;
const highlighter = await highlight();
const html = highlighter.codeToHtml(code, {
  lang: "javascript",
  theme: "one-light",
});
```

## Themes

There are multiple themes available in the `@shikijs/themes` package. You can find the full list of themes in the [Shiki Themes documentation](https://shiki.style/themes).

If you need to use a different theme:

1. Update the import statements in the `shiki-highlighter.ts` file:

```ts
// Themes:
import lightTheme from "@shikijs/themes/one-light"; // Light Theme
import darkTheme from "@shikijs/themes/one-dark-pro"; // Dark Theme
```

2. Update the `Themes` type:

```ts
type Themes = "one-light" | "one-dark-pro";
```

## Languages

There are multiple languages available in the `@shikijs/langs` package. You can find the full list of languages in the [Shiki Languages documentation](https://shiki.style/languages).

If you need to use different languages:

1. Update the import statements in the `shiki-highlighter.ts` file:

```ts
// Languages:
import js from "@shikijs/langs/js";
import ts from "@shikijs/langs/ts";
import tsx from "@shikijs/langs/tsx";
//...
```

2. Update the `Languages` type:

```ts
type Languages = "js" | "ts" | "tsx" | ... ;
```
