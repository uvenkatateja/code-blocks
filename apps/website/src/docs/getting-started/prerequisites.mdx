[**Code-Blocks**](https://code-blocks.pheralb.dev) separates components and utilities. You can use them independently. However, some components depend on specific libraries to function correctly:

## Components

> If you're using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), you can skip this section as the required dependencies are already included.

1. Create a new React app:

<CreateReactApp />

2. Add Tailwind CSS to your project by following the official [Tailwind CSS Installation Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

3. Install the following dependencies:

<CopyWithPkgManager
  title="Shiki Dependencies"
  type="install"
  command="clsx tailwind-merge"
/>

Optional, install [``lucide-react``](https://lucide.dev/) for icons:

<CopyWithPkgManager
  title="Lucide React"
  type="install"
  command="lucide-react"
/>

4. Create the `cn` utility function:

```ts title="src/utils/cn.ts"
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

## Utilities

All the utilities are built using TypeScript. You'll only need install the highlighter library you choose to use:

<HighlightsAvailable />
