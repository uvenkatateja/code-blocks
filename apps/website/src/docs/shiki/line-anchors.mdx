## Installation

### shadcn/ui

<CopyShadcnCommand name="shiki-line-anchors" />

### Manual

1. Copy the `lineAnchors` transformer into your project:

<ShowSource component="shiki-line-anchors" />

`shiki-line-anchors` styles are defined in the `shiki.css` file:

<DocCard folder="shiki" document="highlighter" anchor="styles" />

2. Import the transformer in your `rehypeShiki` plugin:

```ts title="Rehype Shiki Options"
import { lineAnchors } from "@/utils/shiki/transformers/line-anchors";

const rehypeShikiOptions: RehypeShikiCoreOptions = {
  //...
  transformers: [lineAnchors()],
};

export { rehypeShikiOptions };
```

Then, each line in your code blocks will have an anchor link (e.g., `#L1`, `#L2`) that users can click to navigate to specific lines.
